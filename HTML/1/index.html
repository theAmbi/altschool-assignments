        <p>Hello, I am <strong>Golden Ekpendu</strong>, a student of AltSchool Africa. <br>
            I am 23 years old and a current student in the 2024 AltSchool TInyuka Cohort. <br>
            Since I was little, I have
            always loved computers, and even though I didn't have one until I was 19, whenever I got the chance to use
            one - whether at school or a computer belonging to a friend, I used it to practice my typing (all I wanted
            back then was to type without looking at the keyboard!). <br><br>In 2020, I joined a tech program which
            introduced me to the world of HTML & CSS. I was fascinated learning about the Web and how it works, and then
            I decided I would learn what was needed to create and design my very own site. <br><br>


            <br> Currently, I work as a graphic
            designer, but I also have a massive love for coding and development. <br>
            I am enrolled in the School of Engineering for the Frontend Engineering course. <br><br>
            I joined the
            AltSchool programme to improve my coding skills. I was introduced to the world of web development in 2021
            and since then I have taught myself through Youtube tutorials and articles.
            <br><br><strong> My goals at AltSchool include the following: </strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Developing my skills to become a world-class frontend developer. equipped with
                skills to solve real-world problems and create better user experiences in applications.</li>
            <li>
                Creating my very own software product.
            </li>
            <li>
                I also aim to meet new friends with whom I can learn more and collaborate with on innovative
                projects.
            </li>
        </ol>
